    "Q1. Explanation for using the Exception class in Custom Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are used to handle errors and exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. When built-in exceptions provided by Python's standard library do not accurately represent the specific error condition that your code might encounter, you can create custom exceptions. To create a custom exception, you need to define a new class that inherits from the base class for all exceptions, which is the `Exception` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Exception` class provides a solid foundation for custom exceptions because it already contains the necessary functionality and behavior expected from an exception class. By inheriting from `Exception`, your custom exception automatically gains features like stack trace information, error message handling, and proper exception propagation through the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you raise a custom exception in your code, it behaves just like any other built-in exception, allowing you to catch and handle it appropriately using `try` and `except` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of creating a custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"This is a custom exception.\")\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught custom exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following Python code to print the Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(\" \" * indent + exception_class.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Python Exception Hierarchy:\")\n",
    "    print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code recursively traverses the exception hierarchy starting from `BaseException` and prints the class names with an indentation to visualize the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Errors defined in the ArithmeticError class and examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ArithmeticError` class is the base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations. It provides common error handling for arithmetic-related issues. Two of the common errors defined in this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "2. `OverflowError`: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed within the available numeric range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ZeroDivisionError example\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "\n",
    "# OverflowError example\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = math.exp(1000)  # Raises OverflowError for large values\n",
    "except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Purpose of LookupError class and examples of KeyError and IndexError:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LookupError` class is used as the base class for exceptions that occur when looking up a key or index in a collection. It handles errors related to accessing elements that are not present in the collection. Since it's a base class, you typically catch more specific exceptions that inherit from `LookupError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `KeyError`: Raised when trying to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist.\n",
    "2. `IndexError`: Raised when trying to access an index in a sequence (e.g., list, tuple) that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# KeyError example\n",
    "my_dict = {\"apple\": 1, \"banana\": 2, \"orange\": 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_dict[\"grape\"])  # Raises KeyError because \"grape\" key does not exist\n",
    "except KeyError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "\n",
    "# IndexError example\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_list[3])  # Raises IndexError because index 3 is out of range\n",
    "except IndexError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explanation of ImportError and ModuleNotFoundError:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ImportError`: In Python, `ImportError` is raised when an import statement fails to find and load a module. This error typically occurs when the module being imported doesn't exist or there is an issue with the import statement itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ModuleNotFoundError`: `ModuleNotFoundError` is a subclass of `ImportError` introduced in Python 3.6. In older versions of Python, the same error was raised as `ImportError` when the module was not found. Starting from Python 3.6, if a module is not found, `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised to provide more explicit information about the nature of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a file named `mymodule.py`, and you want to import it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import mymodule  # Assuming mymodule.py doesn't exist in the current directory\n",
    "except ImportError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the code, it will raise `ModuleNotFoundError` (or `ImportError` in older Python versions) since the `mymodule` module doesn't exist in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be specific in catching exceptions: Instead of using a generic `except` block, catch specific exceptions that you anticipate might occur. This helps in understanding the root cause of the issue and provides more targeted error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoid catching `Exception` base class: Catching the base `Exception` class can lead to unexpected behavior and hide critical errors. It is better to catch more specific exceptions and let other unexpected exceptions propagate naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use finally block when necessary: The `finally` block ensures that a certain block of code executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is helpful for releasing resources or cleaning up after an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Log exceptions: Always log exceptions, along with relevant information, like stack traces and context. This will aid in debugging and troubleshooting issues in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handle exceptions at the right level: Exception handling should be done at the appropriate level of the program. Don't handle exceptions too early if you can't handle them effectively at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Reraise exceptions cautiously: If you need to rethrow an exception after catching it, use `raise` without any arguments to preserve the original stack trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Avoid using exceptions for flow control: Exceptions should not be used as a standard mechanism for controlling the flow of a program. They should be reserved for exceptional circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keep exception messages clear and informative: Provide meaningful and concise error messages to help users and developers understand the cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Test exception paths in unit tests: Ensure that you have test cases to cover exception scenarios to verify the correctness of your exception handling logic."
